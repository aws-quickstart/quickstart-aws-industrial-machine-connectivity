The primary objective of the Quick Start is to help partners deliver an inexpensive proof of value for a minimum viable product (MVP). For example, a partner might deliver a deployment that helps a customer visualize near-real-time operational metrics and analyze root causes when a line goes down. When customers get a taste of deriving business value from their IIoT architecture, they want to go further to develop and deploy a complete production architecture that addresses all their critical use cases. 

The {partner-product-short-name} Quick Start converts definitions of a customer's asset hierarchy (such as factory, lines, machines, tags) from third-party (AWS Partner) edge software applications to equivalent definitions in AWS IoT SiteWise. Partner edge applications include Inductive Automation's https://inductiveautomation.com/ignition/[Ignition^] and PTC's https://www.kepware.com/en-us/products/kepserverex/[KEPServerEX^].

After asset hierarchies are defined in AWS IoT SiteWise, your data can be ingested continuously to the AWS Cloud. All the pertinent metadata is readily accessible to applications that can use that data to deliver business value. For example, you may set up dashboards that monitor the condition of your assets, as shown at the top of the overview diagram in <<IMC-QS-overview>>. (The example dashboard shown is labeled "MVP" for minimum viable product). Elements of the Quick Start are outlined in the dotted orange box. The text at the right describes what happens from the edge (bottom) and the cloud (top).

//TODO Shivansh, Please supply the source file that Figure 1 was generated from.

//TODO Marcia to update this diagram and description to avoid "IMC framework". Notes from talking with Shivansh (see Quip): What does "IMC framework" mean? Synonymous. Use QS (but keep "ACM framework"). So, remove any remaining references to "IMC framework" in the rest of the doc too. (Remove the term "framework," capitalize "Cloud" when it follows "AWS," "near-real-time," "plant floor" > "factory floor," "historian" lowercase, label purple icon "Amazon QuickSight," eliminate the key, and a few other things.)

The {partner-product-short-name} Quick Start helps connect industrial assets to AWS Cloud services along with visualizing data using AWS IoT SiteWise Monitor and QuickSight dashboards. The IoT partner edge software applications handle the industrial protocol translation from the programmable logic controllers (PLCs), other devices, historians, and supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems they connect to. The {partner-product-short-name} architecture integrates both the data collected by the edge software applications and the asset model hierarchy that they maintain. 

The AWS CloudFormation templates provision the cloud resources and generate the scripts required to bootstrap physical edge devices. 

This Quick Start includes the software and a list of hardware required to connect your assets to the AWS Cloud and visualize your data. It also includes the following modules (drivers):

* Ignition by Inductive Automation
** Cirrus Link MQTT (Message Queue Telemetry Transport) module
** Ignition Project File Export 
* KEPServerEX by PTC
** KEPServerEX Project File Export
