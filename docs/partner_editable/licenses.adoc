// Include details about the license and how they can sign up. If no license is required, clarify that. 

There are no licenses required to deploy this Quick Start. All AWS service resources consumed during the launch of the Quick Start incur AWS service usage costs.

Some configurations of the {partner-product-short-name} Quick Start involve the use of third-party software. You are responsible for obtaining a license directly from the software vendor. Two software vendors have products that integrate with the {partner-product-short-name} Quick Start:

. Inductive Automation (Ignition Server)
* Cirrus Link Solutions (MQTT transmission module supported)
. PTC (KEPServerEX)

//TODO Marcia, Check how this list looks. It's supposedly showing two software vendors, so I'm not sure why it shows three lines.
