// Include details about the license and how they can sign up. If no license is required, clarify that. 

There are no licenses required to deploy this Quick Start. All AWS service resources consumed during the launch of the Quick Start will incur AWS service usage costs.

Some configurations of the {partner-product-short-name} Quick Start will involve the use of third-party software. The user is responsible for obtaining a license directly from the software vendor. Two software vendors have products that integrate with the {partner-product-short-name} Quick Start:

. Inductive Automation (Ignition Server)
* Cirrus Link Solutions' MQTT Transmission Module supported
. PTC (KEPServerEX)

//TODO Marcia, Check how this list looks. It's supposedly showing two software vendors, so I'm not sure why it shows three lines.
