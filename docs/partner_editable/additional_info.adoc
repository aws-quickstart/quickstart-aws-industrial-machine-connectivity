=== Asset Model Converter

The Asset Model Converter (AMC) code is in two separate Lambda functions located in the functions or source directory of the repository.

* AssetModelIngestion. This is the ingestion Lambda function. Its purpose is to listen to MQTT messages coming from the CirusLink Ignition module and put them into the incoming S3 bucket as objects. The relevant handler file is `assetModelIngestion.py`. 
* AssetModelConverter. The AMC covers two functions: AMC1 and AMC2. 
** AMC1 
*** This code is initiated by an Amazon S3 object creation from the incoming bucket. It has its reserved concurrent executions set to 1 to make sure that only a single instance of Lambda can ever fire at the same time. This has been done because the Ignition Cirrus Link module can birth the asset structure as multiple discrete MQTT messages, each of which becomes a file object in Amazon S3.
*** The core logic of the AMC1 comes in the form of the main handler file, `assetModelConverter.py`. It contains the base Lambda handler function, which in turn calls into the AssetModelConverter class to execute the handling of a given S3 object-creation event. This code in turn calls the relevant driver code to handle the asset structure files.
*** AMC drivers in AMC1 are responsible for parsing the incoming asset structure files and converting them into a normalized format that is then stored into DynamoDB. See the "Creating AMC Drivers" section of the Getting Started guide for more details on creating drivers and the DynamoDB normalized format.
//TODO Shivansh, What is this Getting Started guide (above)? How do people find it?
** AMC2
*** This relevant code file here is `createSitewiseResources.py`. This contains code to take the normalized DynamoDB format, and create relevant AWS IoT Sitewise assets and models from that format. Changes are marked in the DynamoDB table to various assets or models that require updates or creation.
*** All AWS IoT Sitewise interactions take place in the `sitewiseUtils.py` code. 
*** Only additive changes are supported.
*** The AMC2 process:
. Model creation. The DynamoDB models table is queried to look for models that require creation. Those are created in AWS IoT Sitewise.
. Asset creation. The DynamoDB assets table is also queried, looking for records that are marked as needing creation. Those assets, instances of the models created during 'Model Creation' are then created in AWS IoT Sitewise.
. Model hierarchies. In this step models are associated with each other in a hierarchy that are tagged as having such a parent-child relationship.
. Asset associations. Similarly in this final step, assets that are tagged as having a parent-child relationship are associated with each.

=== Creating AMC drivers

. Write the driver that interprets the incoming hierarchy data from your edge-based asset modeling software and converts it into the AMC-approved format (see the format here) and puts it into DynamoDB.

//TODO Shivansh, In the previous sentence, what does "format here" refer to ... a downloadable file? ... a web page?

//TODO Shivansh, What's the URL for that "format here" link?

.. Refer to the template file for guidance while writing your driver:
... `/functions/source/AssetModelConverter/drivers/example_driver_template.py`
.. ** Highly recommended – also refer to the existing drivers: 
... `/functions/source/AssetModelConverter/drivers/igniitonCirrusLinkDriver.py`
... `/functions/source/AssetModelConverter/drivers/ignitionFileDriver.py`
... `/functions/source/AssetModelConverter/drivers/kepserver_file_driver.py`
. Edit the entry point file for the AMC (`/functions/source/AssetModelConverter/assetModelConverter.py`) to use your new driver:
.. Import your driver with import statement (replacing the information in brackets):
... `From drivers.<name_of_file> import <name_of_driver_class>`
.. Add your driver to the 'driverTable' list.
... `<name_of_driver>:<name_of_driver_class>`
. Replace the AssetModelConverter zip file with its new contents:
.. Zip up the contents of `/functions/source/AssetModelConverter/`
.. Name the .zip file `AssetModelConverter.zip`.
.. Replace the old `AssetModelConverter.zip` file (`/functions/packages/AssetModelConverter/AssetModelConverter.zip`) with the new `AssetModelConverter.zip` file you created. 
. Edit the AWS CloudFormation template to include your driver's name: 
.. `/templates/IMC-workload.template.yaml`
... Add an item to the list of AMCDrivers (parameter section):
.... `<name_of_driver>`

=== Set up a QuickSight dashboard along with the {partner-product-short-name} Quick Start deployment

After the {partner-product-short-name} Quick Start deployment succeeds (models and assets have finished creation in AWS IoT SiteWise), the following manual steps are required to create a QuickSight dataset. 

. Allow QuickSight access to the S3 bucket that houses the data from the {partner-product-short-name} Quick Start. 
.. Choose *Manage QuickSight* from the top-right corner.

.QuickSight—Manage QuickSight
[link=images/QSManageQS.png]
image::../images/QSManageQS.png[Manage QuickSight]

Choose *Security & permissions*. Under *QuickSight access to AWS services*, choose *Add or remove*.

.QuickSight—Security and permissions
[link=images/QSSecurityAndPermissions.png]
image::../images/QSSecurityAndPermissions.png[Security and permissions]

Under *QuickSight access to AWS services*, select *Amazon S3*.

.QuickSight—Access to AWS services
[link=images/QSAccessToServices.png]
image::../images/QSAccessToServices.png[Access to AWS services]

Find the S3 bucket labeled `<IMCQSDeploymentName>...-imcs3bucket-….`, select it, and choose *Finish*.

[link=images/QS-MQTT-Client.png]
image::../images/QS-MQTT-Client.png[Test client]

Initiate the creation of your QuickSight dataset by publishing an MQTT message to the MQTT topic: `imc/control/quicksight`. Enter anything; the content of your message is inconsequential.

.AWS IoT Core—MQTT publish message
[link=images/QS-MQTT-Publish.png]
image::../images/QS-MQTT-Publish.png[MQTT publish message]

After the message is published, a dataset called `imcDataSet` populates the QuickSight dataset dashboard. Click into the dataset to create a visualization analysis.

.QuickSight datasets
[link=images/QS-Datasets.png]
image::../images/QS-Datasets.png[QuickSight datasets]

Now that you've created a dataset in QuickSight, you can create visualizations with the data. For details, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksight/latest/user/welcome.html[What Is Amazon QuickSight?^]

=== Launch the AWS CloudFormation stack from your own S3 bucket

This section tells how to extend or modify the {partner-product-short-name} Quick Start with new features or capabilities. Here's the high-level process: clone the https://github.com/aws-quickstart/quickstart-aws-industrial-machine-connectivity[{partner-product-short-name} Quick Start repo^], create a new S3 bucket, and add the repo assets to that bucket. The following instructions detail the process:

. Create a new S3 bucket. and give it a unique name such as *imc-dev-123*.
. In that S3 bucket, create a folder called *quickstart-IMC*.
. Download the public {partner-product-short-name} Quick Start Github repo (https://github.com/aws-quickstart/quickstart-aws-industrial-machine-connectivity) as a zip file.
. Unzip the downloaded file, and copy all the contents of the unzipped folder (Github repo contents) into the *quickstart-IMC* folder in your S3 bucket. The structure then resembles the following structure:
.. S3 bucket name: `imc-dev-123`
.. S3 bucket content:
