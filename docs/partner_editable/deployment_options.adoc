// There are generally two deployment options. If additional are required, add them here

This Quick Start provides two deployment options:

* *Deploy {partner-product-name} into a new VPC*. This option builds a new AWS environment consisting of the VPC, subnet, security group, and other infrastructure components. It then deploys {partner-product-name} into this new VPC.
* *Deploy {partner-product-name} into an existing VPC*. This option provisions {partner-product-name} in the default VPC of your existing AWS infrastructure.

The Quick Start provides separate templates for these options.
